# tokenizer_tests
Playing around with anomalous tokens

Run `setup.sh` and populate the created `local_settings.py` with your OpenaI API secret (don't worry, it's .gitignore'd)

I used Python 3.9.16 to run this code, though another version may work as well.

You can open an IPython shell with `./shell.py`
