# tokenizer_tests
Playing around with anomalous tokens

To use this, you'll need to run:

`pip install openai`
`pip install tiktoken`

I used Python 3.9.16 to run this code, though another version may work as well.

For the code to run, you'll need to make a new file called `local_settings.py` in the same directory as `settings.py`, and populate it with the following line:

`OPENAI_SECRET_KEY = "[Your OpenAI secret key here]"`
